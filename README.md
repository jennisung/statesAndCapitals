# States And State Capitals Trivia

## Overview
Today you'll be using Java Streams, Collections, and lambda functions to figure out some state trivia. Unlike your other labs, you won't be building anything today, or have to code any tests. All the tests are already set up for you! You just have to make them pass.

## Setup
Look in the demo folder for a folder called statesAndCapitals. Open that project in IntelliJ. Open the StatesAndCapitals.java file and you'll see all the tests you have to implement. StatesAndCapitalsTest.java kicks off the tests, which live inside StatesAndCapitals.testStatesAndCapitals().

## Feature Tasks
- Get the unit tests up through the end of Advanced 2 working. (This means the Basic, Intermediate, Advanced 1, and Advanced 2 tests should all be working.) The results of your tests are printed at the end of testStatesAndCapitals() with "System.out.println(testResults);". "true" means a test is passing, while "false" means it is failing.
- Alternately, submitting any 19 working tests is fine too.
